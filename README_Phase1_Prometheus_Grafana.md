## 🔧 Formatting & Consistency

- Standardized all section titles (e.g., “Installing Prometheus,” “Connecting Prometheus to Grafana”) for consistency.  
- Unified formatting across all tool sections (Prometheus, Grafana, Exporters, Alertmanager).  
- Added clear code blocks for commands and YAML snippets.  
- Used consistent bullet and note formatting to match internal documentation standards.

## 🧹 Redundancies Removed

- Combined repeated notes about restarting Prometheus and exporters.  
- Removed unnecessary parenthetical reminders and merged similar sentences for conciseness.

- Improved flow and grammar for each installation section.  
- Simplified technical explanations for better readability while retaining accuracy.  
- Added example PromQL rule for Alertmanager to improve completeness.

## 💡 Recommended Additions (Optional)

- Add screenshots to each installation section for visual context (UI, config examples, etc.).  
- Insert your repository link in the “Repository” section.  
- Consider adding Confluence macros for improved readability:
  - **Table of Contents** at the top.  
  - **Info or Code macros** for notes and code blocks.

## 📘 Summary

This revised document is ready for publication in Confluence as-is. It maintains a professional internal documentation tone, improves readability,
